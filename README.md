[Deployed App](https://bradotron.github.io/TriviaGame/)

# Using the App
On the landing page the user is presented with a single giant "play" button. After pressing the button, the game begins. The gameplay will continue at this point without any player input. The user will be presented with a multiple choice question. After clicking an answer, the game lets the user know if the answer was correct or wrong, then presents the next question after a short break. After five questions, the game ends and the user is presented their score and a button to start the game again.
